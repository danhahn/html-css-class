## Overview
As an extension to CSS, Less is not only backwards compatible with CSS, but the extra features it adds use existing CSS syntax. This makes learning Less a breeze, and if in doubt, lets you fall back to vanilla CSS.

## Variables

These are pretty self-explanatory:
```less
@nice-blue: #5B83AD;
@light-blue: @nice-blue + #111;

#header {
  color: @light-blue;
}
```
Outputs:
```css
#header {
  color: #6c94be;
}
```
**Note:** that variables are actually "constants" in that they can only be defined once.

## Mixins

Mixins are a way of including ("mixing in") a bunch of properties from one rule-set into another rule-set. So say we have the following class:
```css
.bordered {
  border-top: dotted 1px black;
  border-bottom: solid 2px black;
}
```
And we want to use these properties inside other rule-sets. Well, we just have to drop in the name of the class where we want the properties, like so:

```less
#menu a {
  color: #111;
  .bordered;
}

.post a {
  color: red;
  .bordered;
}
```

The properties of the .bordered class will now appear in both #menu a and .post a. (Note that you can also use #ids as mixins.)

## Nested Rules

Less gives you the ability to use nesting instead of, or in combination with cascading. Let's say we have the following CSS:

```css
#header {
  color: black;
}
#header .navigation {
  font-size: 12px;
}
#header .logo {
  width: 300px;
}
```
In Less, we can also write it this way:

```less
#header {
  color: black;
  .navigation {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
  .logo {
    width: 300px;
  }
}
```
The resulting code is more concise, and mimics the structure of your HTML.

You can also bundle pseudo-selectors with your mixins using this method. Here's the classic clearfix hack, rewritten as a mixin (& represents the current selector parent):
```less
.clearfix {
  display: block;
  zoom: 1;

  &:after {
    content: " ";
    display: block;
    font-size: 0;
    height: 0;
    clear: both;
    visibility: hidden;
  }
}
```
## Nested Directives and Bubbling

Directives such as media or keyframe can be nested in the same way as selectors. Directive is placed on top and relative order against other elements inside the same ruleset remains unchanged. This is called bubbling.

Conditional directives e.g. `@Media`, `@supports` and `@document` have also selectors copied into their bodies:

```less
.screen-color {
  @media screen {
    color: green;
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      color: red;
    }
  }
  @media tv {
    color: black;
  }
}
```
outputs:

```css
@media screen {
  .screen-color {
    color: green;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .screen-color {
    color: red;
  }
}
@media tv {
  .screen-color {
    color: black;
  }
}
```
Remaining non-conditional directives, for example font-face or keyframes, are bubbled up too. Their bodies do not change:

```less
#a {
  color: blue;
  @font-face {
    src: made-up-url;
  }
  padding: 2 2 2 2;
}
```
outputs:
```css
#a {
  color: blue;
}
@font-face {
  src: made-up-url;
}
#a {
  padding: 2 2 2 2;
}
```
## Operations

Arithmetical operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` can operate on any number, color or variable. If it is possible, mathematical operations take units into account and convert numbers before adding, subtracting or comparing them. The result has leftmost explicitly stated unit type. If the conversion is impossible or not meaningful, units are ignored. Example of impossible conversion: px to cm or rad to %.

```less
// numbers are converted into the same units
@conversion-1: 5cm + 10mm; // result is 6cm
@conversion-2: 2 - 3cm - 5mm; // result is -1.5cm

// conversion is impossible
@incompatible-units: 2 + 5px - 3cm; // result is 4px

// example with variables
@base: 5%;
@filler: @base * 2; // result is 10%
@other: @base + @filler; // result is 15%
```

Multiplication and division do not convert numbers. It would not be meaningful in most cases - a length multiplied by a length gives an area and css does not support specifying areas. Less will operate on numbers as they are and assign explicitly stated unit type to the result.

```less
@base: 2cm * 3mm; // result is 6cm
```

Colors are split into their red, green, blue and alpha dimensions. The operation is applied to each color dimension separately. E.g., if the user added two colors, then the green dimension of the result is equal to sum of green dimensions of input colors. If the user multiplied a color by a number, each color dimension will get multiplied.

Note: arithmetic operation on alpha is not defined, because math operation on colors do not have standard agreed upon meaning. Do not rely on current implemention as it may change in later versions.

An operation on colors always produces valid color. If some color dimension of the result ends up being bigger than ff or smaller than 00, the dimension is rounded to either `ff` or `00`. If alpha ends up being bigger than `1.0` or smaller than `0.0`, the alpha is rounded to either `1.0` or `0.0`.

```less
@color: #224488 / 2; //results in #112244
background-color: #112244 + #111; // result is #223355
```
## Escaping

Escaping allows you to use any arbitrary string as property or variable value. Anything inside ~"anything" or ~'anything' is used as is with no changes except interpolation.

```less
.weird-element {
  content: ~"^//* some horrible but needed css hack";
}
```
results in:

```css
.weird-element {
  content: ^//* some horrible but needed css hack;
}
```
## Functions

Less provides a variety of functions which transform colors, manipulate strings and do maths. They are documented fully in the function reference.

Using them is pretty straightforward. The following example uses percentage to convert 0.5 to 50%, increases the saturation of a base color by 5% and then sets the background color to one that is lightened by 25% and spun by 8 degrees:
```less
@base: #f04615;
@width: 0.5;

.class {
  width: percentage(@width); // returns `50%`
  color: saturate(@base, 5%);
  background-color: spin(lighten(@base, 25%), 8);
}
```
## Namespaces and Accessors

(Not to be confused with CSS `@namespace` or namespace selectors).

Sometimes, you may want to group your mixins, for organizational purposes, or just to offer some encapsulation. You can do this pretty intuitively in Less, say you want to bundle some mixins and variables under #bundle, for later reuse or distributing:
```less
#bundle {
  .button {
    display: block;
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: grey;
    &:hover {
      background-color: white
    }
  }
  .tab { ... }
  .citation { ... }
}
```
Now if we want to mixin the .button class in our #header a, we can do:
```less
#header a {
  color: orange;
  #bundle > .button;
}
```
Note that variables declared within a namespace will be scoped to that namespace only and will not be available outside of the scope via the same syntax that you would use to reference a mixin (`#Namespace > .mixin-name`). So, for example, you can't do the following: (`#Namespace > @this-will-not-work`).

## Scope

Scope in Less is very similar to that of programming languages. Variables and mixins are first looked for locally, and if they aren't found, the compiler will look in the parent scope, and so on.
```less
@var: red;

#page {
  @var: white;
  #header {
    color: @var; // white
  }
}
```
Variables and mixins do not have to be declared before being used so the following Less code is identical to the previous example:
```less
@var: red;

#page {
  #header {
    color: @var; // white
  }
  @var: white;
}
```
## Comments

Both block-style and inline comments may be used:

```less
/* One hell of a block
style comment! */
@var: red;

// Get in line!
@var: white;
```

## Importing

Importing works pretty much as expected. You can import a .less file, and all the variables in it will be available. The extension is optionally specified for `.less` files.
```less
@import "library"; // library.less
@import "typo.css";
```
