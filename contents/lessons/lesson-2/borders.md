Borders can be added to most every element and are made up of three parts.

* `border-width:` defines the width of the border, If no border is defined the default size is 3px.
* `border-style:` defines how the border will look.  There are a number of options including solid, double, dotted and dashed.
* `border-color:` defines the color of the border.  If no color is defined the current font color will be used.

A border canâ€™t be defined on an element with out at least the border-style because there is no default value.  If you only define a border-style the border will be 3px thick and have the current font color.

`border-*` will define the border for all sides.  If you need to define a border for only side there are border-[top,right,bottom,left]-[width,style,color] that can be used.
### For example

    border-bottom-width: 1px;
    border-bottom-style: solid;
    border-bottom-color: green;

### Using border
CSS has short hand way to easily define a border.  The border property takes up to three values.

    border: {width} {style} {color};

The only required property is style, the other two are option but recommended.  If the options values are not set the are set to the default value.

Again if you need to target one side of a border you can use border-[top,right,bottom,left].
### For example

    border-top: 2px dashed #ff00ff;

Since you can only define one value for each option in the shorthand there is no easy way to set each side to a different value.  In this case you will need to set each with its own property.

### For example

    border-top: 10px dotted blue;
    border-bottom: 8px solid yellow;
