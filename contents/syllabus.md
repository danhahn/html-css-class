Attendance: Every class is very important and will build off of the class before; therefore
you must attend class every week. If you do miss a class, you are expected to make up
the work before the next class. If you know in advance that you will miss a class, please
contact me 24 hours before the class. Missing TWO or more classes will result in failure
of the course.
